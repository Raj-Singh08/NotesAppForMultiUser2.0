<div>
    <ng-content/> <!--If we dont use ng-content then this card's templete will replace the template which it is wrapped arount
    that is <app-card>hello</app-card> so hello will replaced by inside of this div, since there is nothing inside div so 
    nothing will show in frontend , so to merege both templete we use nr-content
    ******Act as place holder for the wrapped markup****
    *************this mechanism & feature is called "content projection"********************
